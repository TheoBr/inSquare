INFO
------------
inSquare is a uniquely minimal watchface designed for the Pebble and Pebble Steel. A simple square with the numbered time inside, inSquare takes the minimalist digital concept and makes it elegant. With a simple customization page allowing for 3 different, unqiue modes, as well as a "vibrate on disconnect" toggle, inSquare is a great option for your wrist. With 200 users and counting, inSquare is a well loved watchface by both it's users and developers


CHANGELOG
------------

####v1.2 (in development)
InverseView battery was added, but as of SDK 4.0, inverseLayer has been deprecated. Changes to be reverted.

####v1.1

Small update with a cool concept! v1.1 introduces Bottom Battery Bar, which turns the bottom bar into an indicator of your Pebble's battery life. We would have liked for this to indicate your phone's battery life, but sadly watchfaces aren't able to get that information. If this feature interests you, please let us know! We plan to add an additional way to view this information soon!


####v1.0

Huge update! We've finally condensed both inSquare and splitSquare into a single version. To do this, we had to stop using png backdrops and moved to dynamically making them through code instead. This will allow for some additional fun features in the future!

By popular request, we also added vibrate on Bluetooth disconnect. It's a toggle disabled by default, but this allows users to know when they've went too far from their phone. We hope you enjoy it!
